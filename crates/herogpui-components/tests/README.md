# Integration test index

This indexes the ~96 integration test binaries under this directory by
feature area. Each `.rs` file here is its own `cargo test` binary. Unit tests
for internals (`#[cfg(test)]` modules) live alongside the implementation
under `src/` instead, and are not listed here.

## Test harness / support

| Binary | Covers | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `source_scan/mod.rs` | Shared helper module (not a standalone test binary): finds a named consumer's enclosing function and asserts a reader/call appears inside it, for source-shape wiring tests. | 0 |

## How to run

Run one binary:

```
cargo test -p herogpui-components --test <name>
```

Filter by test-name substring within a binary:

```
cargo test -p herogpui-components --test <name> <substring>
```

Run the full suite:

```
cargo test -p herogpui-components
```

Local workaround: on this machine, an Xcode license/toolchain issue sometimes
requires pointing `DEVELOPER_DIR` at the command-line tools before running
tests. This is a local workaround, not a repository requirement:

```
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools cargo test -p herogpui-components
```

## Conventions

- **Painted-scene and style readback.** `harness` reads what the headless
  platform can observe beyond layout: `harness::painted` returns the last
  frame's quads (`Window::painted_quads`: solid fill, border colour and widths,
  corner radii, content mask) in logical pixels, with helpers for exact and
  pill-clamped radii, fills, and the offset focus ring's `ring-offset` band
  (`Painted::ring_gaps`, `band_is_clipped`). `harness::style_probe` is a 1px
  canvas that records the `TextStyle` inherited where it is placed, so a probe
  in a caller-owned slot (children, `prefix`, `start_content`, an indicator or
  trigger closure) reads the family, weight, size, line height and colour the
  component's text there draws with. Shadows, paths and sprites (svg icons,
  the focus ring's rasterised band, glyphs) and the cursor are *not*
  exposed, and the `NoopTextSystem` resolves every font to one id.
- **Motion on the real clock.** gpui's `Animation` measures wall time, so a
  motion path is observed with `harness::wait_real` (sleep, then settle) and
  the component's own timing is separated from the theme's by stretching the
  theme's `hover_fade_ms` to a minute (a component with a stylesheet-specific
  duration still settles within it; a Button is the positive control).
- **Source-shape / contract tests.** A few binaries (`cursor_token`,
  `hover_overrides`, `sx_ownership`, `theme_tokens`, `i18n`) are inventories
  or bans by design and read implementation source to check that a call site
  is wired the way the contract requires. Every
  other remaining source-text check is listed, with its reason, under
  *Remaining source-text checks* below; no test includes a component source
  with `include_str!`.
- **`source_scan` helper.** `tests/source_scan/mod.rs` is a shared module
  (`#[allow(dead_code)]`, no tests of its own) that reads a file from
  `src/` and asserts a given call appears inside the enclosing top-level
  function of a named consumer, so a sibling function's call cannot
  satisfy the check. `tests/sx_ownership.rs` documents the fixtures it
  relies on.
- **`#[gpui::test]` render/behavior tests.** Most binaries use
  `#[gpui::test]` with a `TestAppContext`/`VisualTestContext` to mount a
  component, drive it with simulated pointer/keyboard input (including
  focus and typeahead), then assert on reported state, painted
  `debug_bounds` geometry, or the painted scene above. The AccessKit tree is
  not observable headlessly (see `a11y_deep.rs`).
- **`test-support` feature.** `gpui`'s own `test-support` feature is
  enabled only under `[dev-dependencies]` in
  `crates/herogpui-components/Cargo.toml`; it is what supplies the
  headless platform, `VisualTestContext`, and simulated input.
  `herogpui-components` itself defines no `test-support` feature — its
  only feature is `gallery-source`, unrelated to testing.

## Remaining source-text checks

Each check below reads implementation source because the behaviour it guards
leaves no trace the headless platform can read back. They go through
`source_scan::component_src`; none uses `include_str!`.

| Test | What it pins | Why it cannot be observed headlessly |
|---|---|---|
| `alert_deep::pinned_source::the_unstyled_status_is_default` | `Alert::new` seeds `Color::Default` | Default and Accent differ only in the glyph/title colour: no quad, and no slot inside the title for a style probe. |
| `alert_deep::pinned_source::every_status_draws_its_pinned_glyph` | Each status's icon path | `svg()` draws nothing on the test platform (no asset source), and sprites are not exposed. |
| `alert_deep::pinned_source::the_paint_only_tokens_stay_pinned` | Title `font-medium`, muted description, `shadow-surface` | Text colour/weight have no slot to probe; shadows are not exposed. |
| `buttons::toggle_button_press_rides_the_pinned_ramp` (one assertion) | A grouped member's instant `.active` swap to its hover fill | The pressing pointer also hovers it, and the hover-fade layer paints over the skin, so the active endpoint is not separable on the scene. |
| `calendars_deep::calendar_unavailable_cells_ask_for_the_not_allowed_cursor` | `CursorStyle::OperationNotAllowed` on unavailable cells | The test platform keeps the requested cursor private. |
| `close_button_deep::default_svg_uses_the_pinned_margins` | The glyph's `-mx-0.5 my-0.5` | Symmetric margins on a centred 16px child cancel, and the svg is not drawn. |
| `color_geometry_deep::color_swatch_color_name_overrides_hex_accessible_name` | `colorName` as the swatch's accessible name | AccessKit tree only. |
| `focus_ring_overlay::{number_field_group_hands_its_ring_to_a_carrier, date_field_group_hands_its_ring_to_a_carrier, input_rings_both_spellings_as_an_overlay}` | Ringless field chrome plus a non-clipping ring carrier | Field rings have no offset, so they are the rasterised SVG band alone, which paints no quad. |
| `font_seams::color_picker_readout_keeps_mono_and_accepts_a_family` | The hex readout's mono default and `font_family` | The readout is a bare text child with no caller slot, and the text system resolves every family to one font. |
| `nav_deep::current_breadcrumb_publishes_accesskit_current_page_state` | `aria-current="page"` on the last crumb | AccessKit tree only. |
| `parts_pagination::active_page_publishes_accesskit_current_page_state` | `aria-current="page"` on the active page | AccessKit tree only. |
| `pickers_deep::picker_option_labels_never_add_a_virtual_row_ellipsis` | Fixed-height rows keep normal wrapping, no ellipsis | The label box has no selector or slot and glyph runs are not exposed (natural-height wrap is measured by `select_long_values_wrap_the_trigger_and_natural_option_row`). |
| `pickers_deep::picker_trigger_chevrons_use_one_rotating_down_svg` | One down-chevron svg rotated by the shared helper | Svg not drawn; transforms not exposed (the indicator slot is measured by `picker_indicators_sit_in_the_pinned_absolute_end_slot`). |
| `table_tabs_accordion::accordion_and_disclosure_indicators_use_shared_rotating_chevrons` | The shared 250ms chevron rotation | Svg not drawn; transforms not exposed (the shared panel motion is measured by `accordion_and_disclosure_panels_ease_open_and_closed`). |
| `table_tabs_accordion::tabs_use_a_constrained_normal_whitespace_label_slot` | Tab labels wrap in a released-min-width slot | A constrained tab keeps its box whether the label wraps or overflows (verified: the box tests pass with `nowrap`), and the label slot has no selector. |
| `tabs_deep::tabs_shadow_and_accessible_name_are_wired_at_their_parts` | Indicator `shadow-surface`; the pre-measurement fallback reading the overrides; the tab's accessible name; the indicator's default radius call | Shadows are not exposed; the fallback frame is never the presented one (the first frame already has geometry); AccessKit tree only. The `.rounded(crate::util::control_radius(cx))` line is the `design_audit.py` fixture anchor and stays by design (audit-reader integrity). |
| `text_fields::input_group_gates_chrome_and_forwards_the_seam` (one assertion) | InputGroup forwards `height` to the held field | The held field's box has no selector and its content centres in the group either way (the `padding_x` forward is measured). |

The inventories and bans by design: `sx_ownership` (the part-scoped `sx`
inventory, see `docs/agents/components.md`), `hover_overrides` and
`theme_tokens` (token consumers scoped to their owning function, each with a
negative fixture proving the scanner can fail), `cursor_token` (a crate-wide
ban on calling GPUI's `cursor_pointer` directly),
`color_field_blur::the_focus_out_listener_disarms_on_fire_so_every_frame_re_arms_fresh`
(the active-window leg cannot be driven headlessly, where gpui blanks window
focus events) and `i18n` (every `UiString` key resolved in its owning file).

One behaviour test is `#[ignore]`d for a defect it found:
`radius_builders::autocomplete_panel_override_does_not_reach_the_trigger_box`
— `Autocomplete::radius` documents a panel-only override, but the trigger
paints it too.
