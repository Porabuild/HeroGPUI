//! A pointer crossing must repaint the view for every control whose hover
//! feedback is an interpolated ramp.
//!
//! `anim::hover_fade` and `anim::field_chrome_ramp` keep the pointer state in
//! keyed state and record it from an `on_hover` listener that deliberately does
//! not call `cx.notify()` — notifying there turns gpui's paint-time listener
//! reconciliation into an unbounded re-render whenever the element's id is not
//! stable across frames. What repaints instead is gpui's own capture-phase
//! `MouseMoveEvent` handler, and that handler is installed *and notifies* only
//! when the element carries a hover style, so both helpers set one themselves.
//!
//! These tests are the guard on that substitution. They move the pointer and
//! never call `window.refresh()`, so the redraw they observe can only have come
//! from the notify path; with the hover style removed from either helper, every
//! case here fails. The controls are chosen to cover both listeners and both
//! shapes of the fade's hover style: `Input` carries the immediate border
//! endpoint, `Pagination`'s buttons carry none, and `NumberField`'s group goes
//! through `field_chrome_ramp`'s empty refinement.
