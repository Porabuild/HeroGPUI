//! Behaviour tests for three feedback/composition parity gaps:
//!
//! - **Avatar's image-error path** — v3 documents `Avatar.Image.onError`
//!   ("Callback when there's an error loading the image") and
//!   `Avatar.Fallback.delayMs` ("Delay before showing fallback (prevents
//!   flash)"), and its own example drives a deliberately broken URL. This
//!   port used to pick image-vs-initials at build time, so a broken src drew
//!   an empty box. It now loads through a custom gpui image source whose
//!   failure fires `on_error` and arms the fallback, gated by `delay_ms`.
//!
//!   The test platform ships no asset source, so **every** src fails there —
//!   exactly the condition this suite needs. The load is a spawned task, not
//!   a synchronous call: the test executor never advances on its own, so each
//!   test pumps it (`advance_clock`) and forces the frame that observes the
//!   result (`flush_frame`) — a stale frame would answer the probe instead.
//!
//! - **Alert's composed children** — v3's Interactive States: "it can contain
//!   interactive elements like buttons or close buttons", and the v2->v3
//!   migration guide's "With Action Button (End Content)" composes the button
//!   as a child. `Alert` now implements `ParentElement`, so the button is
//!   driven both by the pointer and by the keyboard.
//!
//! - **Badge's default colour** — v3's table gives `color` a default of
//!   `"default"`; the seed was `Danger`. A colour is a theme token, not a
//!   behaviour — nothing a callback can report distinguishes one fill from
//!   another — so this test pins what a badge *can* be probed for (the
//!   anchored badge is inert to the pointer) and the seed change lives in the
//!   source diff, which is what AGENTS.md's "say why rather than asserting on
//!   a colour" asks for.
//!
//! Geometry is derived from the components' own constants (window 1920x1080,
//! as the buttons suite pins):
//!
//! - A `Size::Md` avatar is a 40px box at the origin: centre (20, 20).
//! - A closable/composed Alert is `w_full px-4 py-3`: content's right edge is
//!   1920-16; a composed `Size::Md` Button is 36px tall with `px-4` (16px)
//!   each side and no border, so its centre x is 1904 - 16 - w/2 where w is
//!   the measured label width, and its centre y is 12 + 18 = 30.
//! - A `Size::Md` badge is a 28px box anchored `offset = -28/2 + 4 = -10`
//!   from the anchor's top-right corner; a 64px anchor at the origin puts the
//!   badge's box at x 46..74, y -10..18, centre (60, 4).
