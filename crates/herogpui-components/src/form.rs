//! Form — port of `@heroui/form` (v3).
//!
//! v3's `Form` is a `<form>`: `name` on each field is what makes a submission
//! carry that field's value, and `onSubmit` receives the collected `FormData`.
//! There is no DOM here, and gpui gives a child no way to find its ancestor, so
//! the form is *told* which fields it owns — `Form::field(..)` — instead of
//! discovering them. Everything downstream of that is the same: names, a
//! collected submission, reset, and an invalid path that runs instead of submit.
//!
//! Submission has two doors that share one implementation
//! (`Form::run_submission`): the caller-wired submit button
//! (`Form::submit_handler`, standing in for `<button type="submit">`) and the
//! native form's implicit submission — Enter pressed in a focused field that
//! semantically participates, which the form root's key handler answers. Only
//! the fields that participate carry the Enter reader; a TextArea's Enter is a
//! newline, and a focused submit button submits through its own click.
//!
//! The second door is a GPUI substitute for the browser's implicit submission,
//! not a port of it. A browser picks the *default submitter* — the first
//! submit button in tree order — and skips implicit submission entirely when a
//! form has no submit button and more than one field blocking validation; both
//! rules read the form's children, which are opaque elements here. A browser
//! also lets a field's own keydown handler cancel the keystroke; the controls
//! that own Enter here stop propagation to the same effect. So Enter in a
//! participating field always runs this form's one submission, whoever else
//! could have been the submitter.
//!
//! A blocked Enter-origin submission defers the focus move to the key's
//! release. gpui activates whichever element the frame drawn for the release
//! shows as focused, so focusing a Select trigger or a Switch mid-keystroke
//! would let the release click it — opening or toggling the very control the
//! repair was meant to reach. The form latches the blocked keystroke in keyed
//! state, disarms the release (`prevent_default` gates gpui's activation
//! listener), and moves the focus once the dispatch is over.
//!
//! Read-only controls are the third gate, after disabled and inert: they stay
//! successful (they submit their value) and focusable, but constraint
//! validation bars them — neither a missing value nor a stored error on a
//! read-only field can block a submission, as a native form has it.
//!
//! `validationErrors` is HeroUI v3's `ValidationErrors` record —
//! `Record<string, string | string[]>` — a *name-keyed* mapping of server
//! errors, not a form-level message stack. The form routes it: every named
//! field's own state receives its messages and displays them in its own
//! error slot, exactly as React Aria routes server errors into the field a
//! `<FieldError />` composes. The upstream row is "displayed immediately and
//! cleared when user modifies the field", and both halves live with the
//! field: an edit suppresses only that field's messages, reset hides them
//! all, and each field keeps its own delivery receipt — the record revision
//! stored beside its messages (see `SetServerErrors`) — so a clone of a
//! delivered record re-arms nothing, wherever the field sits or however the
//! registrations churn, while a freshly built record — same content or not —
//! re-arms every named field it mentions. Blocking follows the same
//! routing: a native submit is blocked by a field whose routed messages are
//! present (unless the field is disabled or read-only, which display without
//! blocking), `validationBehavior: "aria"` displays without blocking, and a
//! name nothing displays is a name that never blocks — a control with no
//! error-display path (the live-registered selects, switches, checkboxes and
//! pickers) receives no routed messages at all, so a record can never block a
//! submission invisibly.
//!
//! What is deliberately absent is the HTTP half — `action`, `method`, `encType`
//! and `target`. There is no browser to navigate.
