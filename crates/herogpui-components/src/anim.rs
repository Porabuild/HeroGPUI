//! Motion primitives shared by every animated component.
//!
//! HeroUI v3 drives animation from data attributes: overlays fade in on
//! `[data-entering]`, buttons scale on `[data-pressed]`, and everything is
//! suppressed when the user asks for reduced motion — with no opt-in required
//! from the caller.
//!
//! ## Hover slots never request their own frame
//!
//! [`hover_fade`] and [`field_chrome_ramp`] keep a copy of the pointer state in
//! keyed state, because a colour ramp needs to know which endpoint it is easing
//! towards and gpui hands that out only through a listener. Those listeners
//! record the new value and stop; they must never call `cx.notify()`.
//!
//! gpui reconciles an `on_hover` listener during *paint* whenever the element's
//! interactive state is new, deferring a call so the listener catches up with a
//! pointer that was already inside (`Interactivity::paint` in pinned gpui-pre
//! 0.3.3). That reconciliation is not a user event, so a listener that notifies
//! turns every such frame into a request for another one. It settles only if
//! the element keeps the same id across frames -- and a control whose id comes
//! from a caller-owned state entity does not, if the caller rebuilds that
//! entity in `render`. The result is an unbounded re-render that spins a real
//! app at full CPU and hangs a headless test, where `App::flush_effects` draws
//! every dirty window until none is left.
//!
//! What repaints on a genuine crossing instead is gpui's own hover machinery:
//! when an element carries a hover style, `Interactivity::paint` installs a
//! capture-phase `MouseMoveEvent` handler that notifies the view. That handler
//! is the *only* repaint on offer -- `Window::dispatch_mouse_event` refreshes
//! for an active drag and nothing else -- and it is gated on `hover_style`
//! specifically: a `mouse_cursor`-only element installs the handler but leaves
//! its `hover_state` `None` and so notifies nothing.
//!
//! So the rule is **whoever owns the element's `on_hover` owns its gpui hover
//! style**, and these two helpers own both rather than trusting a caller to
//! supply the second. [`hover_fade`] takes the immediate `hover_border`
//! endpoint that its callers used to apply themselves; [`field_chrome_ramp`]
//! sets an empty refinement, because every endpoint it has is interpolated and
//! a style swap would snap the colour. When an `Interaction` slot is passed,
//! `util::track_interaction` owns the listener and its notify, and that
//! caller keeps its own hover style. A caller that sets a second hover style on
//! the same element trips gpui's own `debug_assert!("hover style already set")`,
//! so the ownership rule cannot be broken silently.
//!
//! This module is the gpui equivalent. Components call [`entering`] instead of
//! reaching for `with_animation` directly, so the reduced-motion check and the
//! duration/easing live in exactly one place.
