//! What each control tells assistive technology, stated once per control.
//!
//! HeroUI v3 owns almost none of this itself: every in-scope component
//! delegates to React Aria Components 1.20.0, which delegates to React Aria
//! 3.51.0's hooks, and the hooks are where the role and the aria attributes
//! are decided. So the contract this module carries is *their* contract, read
//! out of the pinned packages under `web/node_modules` — for example
//! `react-aria/dist/private/toggle/useToggle.js` is what says a checkbox's
//! `aria-required` appears only when the field is required, and
//! `.../progress/useProgressBar.js` is what says an indeterminate bar drops
//! `aria-valuenow` while keeping `aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax`.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Three pieces, in the order a call site meets them:
//!
//! 1. [`Name`] — the accessible name and description. The web builds these by
//!    *reference* (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` pointing at the
//!    rendered `<Label>`, `<Description>` and `<FieldError>` nodes); gpui takes
//!    literal strings, so [`Name::field`] performs the join React Aria's
//!    `useField` performs with ids, once, for every field in the port.
//! 2. [`Range`] — the numeric range a slider, meter, progress bar or spin
//!    button reports. Clamping, the indeterminate case and the value text live
//!    here rather than in four components.
//! 3. [`A11y`] — the extension trait that writes 1 and 2 onto an element.
//!
//! # Why an extension trait, and why it is not on plain `div()`
//!
//! [`A11y`] extends [`StatefulInteractiveElement`], which gpui implements only
//! for elements that already carry an `.id(..)`. That is not an accident of
//! convenience: gpui derives an AccessKit `NodeId` by hashing the element's
//! `GlobalElementId`, so an element with no id produces no node at all and a
//! role set on it is silently dropped (`window/a11y.rs` logs
//! "focused element has no accessibility node"). Hanging the helpers off
//! `StatefulInteractiveElement` means a decorative wrapper cannot accidentally
//! acquire a contract, and a control that wants one has to have earned an id
//! first — which, per [`herogpui_core::element_id`], must be derived from the
//! caller's id rather than a constant, or two instances collide into one node.
//!
//! The role method is spelled [`A11y::a11y`] rather than gpui's own `role`
//! because `role` is already taken twice in this workspace —
//! `ThemeBuilder::role` and `ActiveTheme::role` are colour roles — and
//! `.shots/a11y_audit.py` has to be able to tell a parity claim from a colour
//! lookup by reading the source.
//!
//! # Deliberate omissions
//!
//! gpui-pre 0.3.3's `StatefulInteractiveElement` exposes 25 accessibility
//! builders and no more. React Aria sets these attributes that have no
//! counterpart there, so this port does not carry them:
//!
//! | Upstream attribute | Where React Aria sets it | Why it is omitted |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `aria-disabled` | `useLink`, `useRadioGroup`, `useNumberField` group, pending `Button` | No gpui builder. A disabled control here leaves the tab order instead (`docs/agents/components.md`), which is the observable half. |
//! | `aria-invalid` | every field hook, when invalid | No gpui builder. The message text still reaches the node through [`Name::field`]. |
//! | `aria-required` | every field hook, when `isRequired` | No gpui builder. The visible `*` in [`crate::field::Label`] is the port's only marker. |
//! | `aria-readonly` | `useToggle`, `useRadioGroup`, `useSpinButton` | No gpui builder. |
//! | `aria-errormessage` | every field hook | No gpui builder, and React Aria itself notes it is unsupported by VoiceOver/NVDA and duplicates it into `aria-describedby`, which [`Name::field`] does carry. |
//! | `aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby` | everywhere | gpui has no id-reference graph; the strings are inlined instead. |
//! | `aria-controls` | `useNumberField`'s stepper buttons, `useToggle`, `useDisclosure`, `useOverlayTrigger` | No gpui builder and no id graph to point at. A trigger can say it is expanded ([`A11y::a11y_expanded`]) but not what it expanded. |
//! | `aria-roledescription` | `useNumberField`'s input ("number field") | No gpui builder. |
//! | `aria-live="off"` | `useSlider`'s output | No gpui builder; gpui announces nothing live, so the suppression is moot. |
//! | `role="meter progressbar"` | `useMeter` | AccessKit roles are a single enum; the fallback half of upstream's pair exists only for browsers that do not implement `meter`. `accesskit::Role::Meter` is the half that is true. |
//! | `role="spinbutton"` | `useSpinButton` | `useNumberField` deletes it again (`role: null`) before it reaches the DOM, so the port must not add it. |
//! | `aria-modal="false"` | `useToast`'s `toastProps` | No gpui builder, and `accesskit::Role` is a single enum with no modality flag: `AlertDialog` is the role, and whether it traps focus is not something the node can say. `useDialog` deliberately sets no `aria-modal` at all (a WebKit bug), so a modal and a non-modal dialog are the same node upstream too. |
//! | `role="alert"` + `aria-atomic` | `useToast`'s `contentProps` | The point of that inner node is the live announcement. gpui exposes no live-region builder at all, so the port would be claiming an announcement it cannot make; the toast card's own `alertdialog` node carries the text instead. |
//! | `aria-haspopup` | `useOverlayTrigger`, `useMenuItem`'s submenu rows | No gpui builder. |
//! | `aria-hidden` | `useDisclosure`'s collapsed panel, `useToast`'s hidden content | No gpui builder. A collapsed panel leaves the element tree here instead, which is the stronger version of the same thing. |
//! | `role="presentation"` | `useMenuSection`'s heading | No gpui builder, and none is needed: an element with no role already produces no node (`window/a11y.rs`), which is what `presentation` asks for. |
//! | `role="separator"` | `useSeparator` | AccessKit 0.24 has no `Role::Separator`. `Role::Splitter` is a pane splitter, not a rule. [`crate::separator::Separator`] takes an optional `.id()` so a later AccessKit bump can claim the role; until then the row stays `PENDING` rather than lying. |
//! | `aria-multiselectable` | `useListBox`, `useGridList`, `useGrid` — `selectionMode === 'multiple' ? 'true' : undefined` | No gpui builder. Whether a collection takes more than one selection is not something an AccessKit node can say here; each row's [`A11y::a11y_selected`] still reports its own state. |
//! | `aria-sort` | `useTableColumnHeader` — `isSortedColumn ? sortDirection : 'none'` on a sortable column | No gpui builder. Upstream itself drops it on Android Talkback (`!isAndroid()`) and puts the sort order into `aria-describedby` instead, which is the half [`Name`] can carry. |
//! | `aria-current="page"` | RAC `Breadcrumbs.mjs`'s `linkProps`, and `@heroui/react`'s `Pagination.Link` (`aria-current: isActive ? "page" : undefined`) | No gpui builder and no AccessKit field. The current crumb and the active page are still distinguishable: neither is a link or a pressable button in this port, so they report a different role from their siblings. |
//! | `aria-autocomplete="list"` | `useComboBox`, `useAutocomplete` | No gpui builder. |
//! | `aria-live` / `aria-atomic` / `aria-relevant` | `useTagGroup`'s grid (`'aria-live': isFocusWithin ? 'polite' : 'off'`) | gpui exposes no live-region builder at all, the same reason the toast's inner `role="alert"` node is omitted. |
//! | `aria-colspan` | `useGridCell` | No gpui builder; this port's table has no spanning cells to describe either. |
//!
//! Every one of these is a "gpui has no equivalent" omission in the sense
//! `docs/agents/parity.md` requires: checked against the pinned gpui source,
//! not assumed.
//!
//! # The one omission that is not gpui's fault: a composed trigger
//!
//! React Aria puts the trigger half of an overlay contract —
//! `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-controls` — onto the *caller's own
//! button*, by injecting props through React context: RAC's `MenuTrigger`,
//! `DialogTrigger` and `Disclosure` all hand `buttonProps` down to whatever
//! `<Button>` the caller composed inside them. gpui has no equivalent: an
//! element is built by its owner and a parent cannot reach into a child
//! element it was handed as an `AnyElement`.
//!
//! So the rule in this port is *who owns the element*:
//!
//! * [`crate::accordion::Accordion`] builds its own trigger row, so it states
//!   `Role::Button` and [`A11y::a11y_expanded`] there.
//! * [`crate::disclosure::Disclosure`], [`crate::dropdown::Dropdown`],
//!   [`crate::popover::Popover`] and [`crate::tooltip::Tooltip`] take the
//!   trigger from the caller — a [`crate::button::Button`], or any element at
//!   all. Their triggers therefore report whatever that element reports and no
//!   expansion state. Wrapping the caller's element in a second node with a
//!   button role would report the trigger twice, which is worse than reporting
//!   it once without `aria-expanded`.
//!
//! Closing that gap is not an accessibility change: it needs an expanded-state
//! prop on `Button` that HeroUI v3 does not document (v3's `Button` has no
//! such prop either — RAC injects it), so it would be invented API.
//!
//! ## What the same rule costs the pickers
//!
//! Wave 3 met the sharper form of it. `useComboBox` does not decorate a
//! trigger button — it turns the **text input itself** into the widget:
//! `role: 'combobox'`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`
//! and `aria-activedescendant` all land on `inputProps`, which RAC's
//! `ComboBox` hands to whatever `<Input>` is composed inside it.
//!
//! In this port [`crate::combo_box::ComboBox`] and
//! [`crate::autocomplete::Autocomplete`] *construct* their text field, but
//! they construct it as a [`crate::input::Input`] value and call its `render`;
//! the role is decided inside `Input::render` from its `InputType`, and there
//! is no prop that overrides it. So the field keeps `Role::TextInput` /
//! `Role::SearchInput` — which is what it is — and the combobox half of the
//! contract is stated on the parts the picker does own:
//!
//! * the popup list, which is a real `role="listbox"` upstream too, and its
//!   rows, which are real `role="option"`s;
//! * the highlighted row, through [`A11y::a11y_active_descendant`] — gpui puts
//!   that relation on the descendant rather than the container, so it is the
//!   one piece of `useComboBox`'s input contract that survives not owning the
//!   input;
//! * [`crate::select::Select`]'s and `Autocomplete`'s trigger, which those
//!   components build themselves and which is a `<button>` upstream
//!   (`useSelect` derives it from `useMenuTrigger`), so it states
//!   `Role::Button` and [`A11y::a11y_expanded`].
//!
//! What is lost is `role="combobox"` on the field and its `aria-expanded`.
//! Both need either a role override on `Input` — invented API, since v3's
//! `Input` has no such prop; RAC injects it through `ComboBoxContext` — or a
//! parent that can modify an element it was handed, which gpui does not have.
//!
//! # Wave 4: status and content
//!
//! Most of v3's display surface — `Alert`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Form`,
//! `Kbd`, `ScrollShadow`, `Skeleton`, `Surface`, `Typography` — imports no
//! RAC primitive and authors no `role`. A node there would be an invention.
//! [`crate::spinner::Spinner`] is the exception: `spinner/spinner.js`
//! hard-codes `role: "status"` / `aria-label="Loading"` on the root span,
//! which is why it is the one status node under contract. [`crate::separator::Separator`]
//! is a real AccessKit gap (RAC `Separator` + `useSeparator`, no
//! `Role::Separator` in 0.24), not an id-less constructor.
//!
//! # Wave 5: calendars and overlay-backed fields
//!
//! The calendar family and the colour/date fields that compose it. Each
//! states the role its React Aria hook reports:
//!
//! - [`crate::calendar::Calendar`] / [`crate::range_calendar::RangeCalendar`]:
//!   `Role::Application` on the root (`useCalendarBase`), `Role::Grid` on
//!   each month (`useCalendarGrid`), `Role::Button` plus `aria-selected` on
//!   each day (the pressable half of `useCalendarCell`'s `gridcell`+`button`
//!   pair — this port draws one circle), and `Role::Button` named
//!   "Previous"/"Next" on the nav.
//! - [`crate::date_picker::DateField`] / [`crate::time_field::TimeField`]:
//!   `Role::Group` on the box, `Role::TextInput` on each segment
//!   (`useDateSegment` rewrites the spinbutton into a textbox).
//! - [`crate::date_picker::DatePicker`] / `DateRangePicker`: `Role::Group` on
//!   the field and `Role::Button` plus `aria-expanded` on the trigger they
//!   build themselves.
//! - Colour: `Role::Group` on [`crate::color_picker::ColorArea`], `Role::Slider`
//!   on [`crate::color_picker::ColorSlider`], `Role::TextInput` on
//!   [`crate::color_picker::ColorField`], `Role::RadioGroup` /
//!   `Role::RadioButton` on [`crate::color_picker::ColorSwatchPicker`], and
//!   `Role::Button` plus `aria-expanded` / `Role::Dialog` on
//!   [`crate::color_picker::ColorPicker`], and `Role::Image` on a named
//!   [`crate::color_picker::ColorSwatch`].
//!
//! Groups that take no required id — [`crate::button_group::ButtonGroup`],
//! [`crate::input_group::InputGroup`], [`crate::progress::ProgressCircle`],
//! [`crate::field::Fieldset`], [`crate::toast::ToastViewport`] — report a
//! node only when the caller names them, the same shape as [`crate::toolbar::Toolbar`].
